# WVox: measurements of the reference (Phase 3)

Everything here was measured on the user's own licensed install, for private analysis. Raw renders, CSV tables and plots
are in `measurements/rvox/` and are **not** part of the public repository (git-ignored); this file only records what the
data showed. Reproduce with `python -I nulltest/measure_rvox.py` (needs `pedalboard`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`).

## Method

- **Host:** `pedalboard` 0.9.26 loading *RVox Mono* / *RVox Stereo* from `WaveShell1-VST3 17.1_x64.vst3` (`nulltest/refhost.py`), 512-sample buffers, 48 kHz unless noted, gate off (`-Inf`), Gain 0 unless noted.
- **Signals:** 1 kHz sine bursts (steady state read from the last 0.4 s), 12 kHz sine for sub-millisecond envelopes, step signals, square / noise, impulses.
- **Host defect found and handled:** about 12 % of renders came back with a block of silence or shifted by up to 0.8 s (the shell dropping a buffer). `refhost.render` detects silence where the input is not silent and renders again; after that 120 repeats of one setting agreed to the 0.01 dB printed. Without the re-render the first static sweep had random dips of up to 300 dB.
- **Latency compensation:** pedalboard removes the reported latency, so impulse offsets are 0 by construction; the number to compare is the *reported* latency.

## Results

| Item | Measured | Product page / manual |
|---|---|---|
| Latency (reported) | 64 samples at 44.1 / 48 kHz, 128 at 88.2 / 96 kHz, 256 at 176.4 / 192 kHz | the same figures |
| Parameter maps | Compression: raw 0…1 → −36…0 dB linear; Gain: the same; Gate: raw 0…1 → −80…0 dB linear, raw 0 shows `-Inf dB` | matches ParamXML ranges |
| Output at Compression 0, Gain 0 | exactly −0.0873 dB (a fixed ×0.99) at every level and frequency; no distortion | none stated |
| Gain control | pure output trim: output peak = (level with Gain 0) + Gain, e.g. 0 dBFS in → −12.09 dBFS out at −12; **no ceiling was found**: at Compression 0, +12 dBFS in gives +11.91 dBFS out for every Gain setting, and a 2.0 impulse train comes out at 1.98 | manual: Gain is the limiter ceiling |
| Static transfer (1 kHz sine, peak level x) | each Compression c gives out = x + G(x, c) with G(−80) = −c − 0.09 dB (full make-up) and G(0 dBFS) = −0.09 dB for every c; a very soft, wide knee in between; see `static_summary` in the data: effective slope at −10 dBFS 0.76 / 0.52 / 0.31 / 0.18 / 0.09 / 0.05 for c = −6 … −36 in steps of 6 | "threshold and ratio on one fader" |
| Level where gain is 3 dB below its low-level value | c − 6 dB (for c ≤ −18; −6 at c = −6, −16 at c = −12 at 2 dB resolution) | n/a |
| Knee | no sharp knee at any setting; slope falls smoothly from 1 to its 0 dBFS value over about 50 dB | "soft-knee curve" |
| Attack | gain moves **ahead of the input step**, 0.3 ms before it, and is complete within 0.3 ms (12 kHz, 0.167 ms envelope); a 1 ms tone burst already gets the full steady-state gain (+8.80 dB at −10 dBFS, c = −24) | not stated |
| Release | slow, exponential-like and program dependent: time to 63 % of the move 424 ms (2.9 dB move), 384 ms (5.6 dB), 290 ms (14.5 dB), 240 ms (24.7 dB); 90 % in 970 / 920 / 767 / 634 ms | not stated |
| Detector | follows RMS rather than peak: a square wave and a sine of equal RMS get gains of 15.8 and 16.0 dB, equal peak 13.9 vs 16.0 dB; noise of the same RMS gets 10.1 dB (it has a 13 dB crest factor), so the detector window is short | not stated |
| Stereo | linked; both channels get the gain of the louder one (L −40 dB with R −10 dB: +8.80 dB each; L alone: +22.71 dB); the Mono and Stereo components give the same gain on identical input | n/a |
| Frequency response | flat, ±0.0 dB, 20 Hz … 20 kHz at Compression 0; with Compression −24 the gain is 0.04 dB higher at 20 Hz at −50 dB and 0.28 dB higher at 20 Hz at −20 dB (the detector follows the waveform at very low frequency) | n/a |
| THD | below −147 dB for 1 kHz at −40 … 0 dBFS in all four settings tried (numerical noise floor, the gain is applied smoothly); no harmonic content | n/a |
| Parameter smoothing | Compression and Gain changes take effect within one 0.167 ms envelope window of the block boundary (no ramp); a Gate change glides in about 1.3 ms (10 % at 0.3 ms, 99 % at 1.3 ms) | n/a |
| Gate | downward expander, **hard knee, 2:1**: gain = (level − threshold) below the threshold, 0 dB above, exact to 0.01 dB at 0.5 dB resolution around the threshold (gate −40 dB: −2.09 dB at −42 dB, −0.59 dB at −40.5 dB); attack immediate; release after a 20 dB downward step with the gate at −30 dB: 50 % at 479 ms, 63 % at 531 ms, 90 % at 666 ms (the hidden GateRel default is 130 ms; the relation is not understood yet) | manual: soft knee |

## Not measured, and why

- **Gain-reduction meter ballistics and the Energy / Output meter values:** the VST3 exposes only Bypass, Compression, Gate, Gain (plus generic MIDI controllers), no meter parameters, so the meters cannot be read through a host. The audio gain trajectory above is the closest proxy. Reading the meters would need screen capture of the editor.
- **Hidden GateRel:** not exposed by the VST3, so its effect cannot be separated from the fixed behaviour.
- **Limiter behaviour with the compressor engaged on peaky material:** only steady tones were driven through the compressor and limiter together; transients with compression active are untested.

## Differences from the product documentation

1. The manual calls the Gain control a limiter ceiling; measured, it is an exact post-trim and nothing limits at Compression 0.
2. The manual and product page call the gate knee soft; measured, it is a hard-knee 2:1 expander on the peak level of the signal.

## What this means for Phase 4 (implementation)

Look-ahead of about 1.3 ms (the reported 64 samples at 48 kHz), instant attack on the look-ahead, a slow program-dependent exponential release, an RMS-style detector with a short window, one linked gain for both channels, a smooth static law G(x, c) tabulated from `static_gain.csv`, a fixed ×0.99, and a hard-knee 2:1 gate. The static law has no simple closed form yet; the first implementation will interpolate the measured table.

## Detector model (Phase 4 identification)

Phase 4 needed more than the Phase 3 numbers, so further experiments (`nulltest/ident_*.py`, `fit_detector*.py`, `tune_wvox.py`) looked at what the reference reads as "level". Findings, in the order they were established:

1. **Closed-form static law.** On a dense grid (Compression 0 … -36 dB in 1 dB steps, 1 kHz sine from -100 to +12 dBFS in 1 dB steps, 4181 cells) the gain of a steady sine of peak amplitude x is
   `gain = 0.99 * M / (1 + (M - 1) * x)` with `M = 10^(-Compression / 20)`.
   Median error 0.00002 dB, 99th percentile 0.0005 dB; 13 of 4181 cells differ by more than 0.05 dB (mostly host dropouts and -100 dB tones). So the compressor is a gain that falls with the detected amplitude along a hyperbola, no separate threshold, ratio or knee.
2. **Level reading is the true (inter-sample) peak, not the sample peak.** Steady sines at 8 kHz and 12 kHz get the same gain at any phase; triangle, half-sine and two-tone signals read as their peak. Square, saw and pulse signals read 1.2 - 1.5 times higher than their peak (overshoot proportional to the jump size, 0.233 per unit of jump); a 4x sinc-interpolated peak reproduces the direction but only about half the size of that overshoot, so square-like signals are under-detected by WVox (about 1.5 dB at worst).
3. **Two paths.** Rises are felt at once (a 1 ms burst after silence already gets the full steady-state gain) but the slow state that holds the level takes about 100 - 200 ms to charge: a 20 ms burst at -10 dB registers as -43 dB, a 200 ms burst as -19 dB, a 1.5 s burst as -10 dB. WVox models this as the larger of (a) the true peak of a short window and (b) a slow state in dB that rises toward the peak of a 10 ms window with a time constant of 85 ms.
4. **Release is a function of the distance to the live level, not of time.** The slow state falls at a rate that grows with its distance (dB) above the live level: about 3 / 9 / 17 / 21 dB/s at 1 / 5 / 12 / 18 dB, with a smooth, saturating law (`rate = relA * gap^relQ / (1 + gap / relB)`, fitted constants in `WVoxDsp.h`). This explains both the 240 - 450 ms release of Phase 3 and why gradual level falls (noise burst decays, amplitude modulation) are followed closely.
5. **Gate.** The same slow level drives the 2:1 expander, and the compressor sees the gated signal; with both active the gain is within 0.3 dB of the reference around the threshold.
6. **Look-ahead.** Gain is applied 16 samples (0.33 ms) ahead of a level step, ramping in, and the audio is delayed by the reported 64 / 128 / 256 samples.

What is still not understood: why square / pulse signals read about twice the overshoot of an ideal interpolator; the exact detector windows (the fitted 0.77 ms and 10 ms are the best fit, not measurements); why the release rate is fitted better by a steep power law than by a physical time constant; the behaviour of the unexposed meters and of the hidden GateRel parameter.
